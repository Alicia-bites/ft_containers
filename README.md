# ft_containers
Implementation of a few container types of the C++ standard template library, using *binary trees*.

### How to use
To test the code and compare it to the behaviour of the original standard template library containers :
- In a terminal, type in *sh my_server.sh*
- Check out the *std_out* & *ft_out* files

To execute only the code I wrote :
- In a terminal, type in *make*
- Then, type in *./ft_containers*
